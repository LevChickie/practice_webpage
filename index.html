              <p class="bio"><em>I studied at the <strong><a href="https://www.tum.de/">Technical University of Munich</a></strong> between 2021 and 2024. I learned modern graphic programming techniques, 3D scanning, and deep learning / artificial intelligence development in 2021. I delved into Augmented Reality and game development in 2022. I implemented a serious game for Schön Klinik that helps visually impaired people by teaching them the use of monocular cues with the help of an Augmented Reality application with Hololens 2. I was working on an AR remote collaboration application that would allow experts to investigate machines remotely in 2023.</em></p>
              <p class="bio"><em>Between my bachelor's and master's studies in 2021, I worked as a front-end developer for <strong><a href="https://urss.hu/de/unsere-firma-3/">Uniqa-Raiffeisen Software Services</a></strong> and I integrated additional features into the website of the Austrian Raiffeisen Bank.</em></p>
              <p class="bio"><em>I wrote my thesis on object-oriented programming and code quality control with the help of lint applications. I developed an extension for SonarQube that would allow the developers to control the code quality in additional scripting languages. To further understand my thesis topic, I studied design patterns and coding conventions for multiple programming languages such as Java, C++, C#, and Python.</p>
              <p class="bio"><em>Between 2017 and 2021 I studied at the <strong><a href="https://www.vik.bme.hu/">Budapest University of Technology and Economics</a></strong>. I studied the principles of Assembly and C in 2017 and I learned how to model system architecture and coding in C++ and Java in 2018. I further developed my knowledge of algorithms and encoding techniques in 2019 and I studied cybersecurity and Android development in 2020. In the summer of 2020, I was working for Agrodat to automatize their error detection with an application written in Java.</em></p>
              <p class="bio"><em>I started programming in C# in 2015 during high school with a private tutor who taught me the basics of an object-oriented programming language. I completed a school leaving exam in informatics where I had to write programs in C# and apply changes to a website with HTML.</em></p>
              <p class="bio"><em>I got into programming with the Lego Robot and Mindstorm software during my high school years where I assisted in creating a simple robotic hand. I was introduced to Unity 3D Engine by my uncle Peter Vértesi and I became interested in the way games could be developed.</em></p>

              The old tales talk about cunning and utterly dangerous creatures in the old dungeons. Skeletons, kobolds, liches, but not one of these strikes more fear into the heart of the young adventurers than the mimic. Shapeshifting hunter who understands the human behavior and waits until they lower their guard to devour them. Be a mimic and turn into ordinary objects to lure the adventurers close and collect their gold and magic items. Spend your wealth to build traps or buy more influence and move into lower-level dungeon, and one day you will be the Final Boss of this dungeon!

              We tried to Augment and Gamify the simple game of coin soccer.

              The original game is played by flicking coins on a table.

              Our game renders relevant objects on top of those objects to make it more exciting in the Augmented World.

              This project was developed with the collaborative efforts of: Gabriele Princiotta, Levente Balazs Csik, Jakob Florian Goes, Leon Imhof, Towsif Zahin Khan

              This project was made using: OpenCV, FreeGlut, GLEW, GLFW

              This game was created for the Bullet Hell GameJam 2024. This cooperative bullet hell game approaches the bullet hell genre from another perspective. Instead of dodging the bullets, one player must use the shield to protect the players and the other player must aim towards the enemies. You better work together because you can't shoot through the shield, so the players should organize their movement together!

          <p  class="game">Understanding depth can be quite difficult with visual impairment. People can lose their depth sight in multiple ways, but visual impairment is one of the most common causes. As part of an inter-disciplinary project, I worked on a serious game to help people with visual impairment to use monocular cues to understand depth. We introduced different exercises to an Augmented Reality application that help people with visual impairment.</p>
