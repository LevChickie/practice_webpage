      <h2>Arrow Ambush Adventure</h2>
      <div><p>Defeat the evil robot who attacked your village. Take cover from its rockets and since your arrow barely scarce the armor of the robot, be creative! Pray at the altars of Fire, Water, Lightning and Ice to empower your arrows, turn the environment against the robot, use elemental combinations to further empower your attacks and aim at the weak points to score critical hits!</p><a class="mbn" href="https://levchickie.itch.io/take-cover-boss-battle-game">Demo</a></div>

      <h2>Labyrinth</h2>
      <div>
          <p>
              Project Labyrinth is a minigame that investigates various Wayfinding methods in a maze game where the player controlls a minotaur that tries to escape the maze. There are enemies and there are treasure and healing potions to find. Sneak or Bash your way to the exit of a procedurally generated labyrinth.

      <h2>Mimic</h2>
      <div>
          <p>
              The old tales talk about cunning and utterly dangerous creatures in the old dungeons. Skeletons, kobolds, liches, but not one of these strikes more fear into the heart of the young adventurers than the mimic. Shapeshifting hunter who understands the human behavior and waits until they lower their guard to devour them. Be a mimic and turn into ordinary objects to lure the adventurers close and collect their gold and magic items. Spend your wealth to build traps or buy more influence and move into lower-level dungeon, and one day you will be the Final Boss of this dungeon!

      <h2>ARCoinSoccer</h2>
      <div>
          <p>
              We tried to Augment and Gamify the simple game of coin soccer.

              The original game is played by flicking coins on a table.

              Our game renders relevant objects on top of those objects to make it more exciting in the Augmented World.

              This project was developed with the collaborative efforts of: Gabriele Princiotta, Levente Balazs Csik, Jakob Florian Goes, Leon Imhof, Towsif Zahin Khan

              This project was made using: OpenCV, FreeGlut, GLEW, GLFW

      <h2>Panda Plaza</h2>
      <div>
          <p>
              This is a tile-based game where the players are controlling Orangutans in a plaza and they need to catch the Pandas. But beware, some pandas are sleepy and would fall asleep if they see a sofa or they might stop eating at the vending machine. The game was a joint project of four software engineers and we implemented it in a couple of weeks from the graphics to the game logic. Members:

      <h2>SpiAR – Serious Game for visual impaired people</h2>
      <div>
          <p>Understanding depth can be quite difficult with visual impairment. People can lose their depth sight in multiple ways, but visual impairment is one of the most common causes. As part of an inter-disciplinary project, I worked on a serious game to help people with visual impairment to use monocular cues to understand depth. We introduced different exercises to an Augmented Reality application that help people with visual impairment.</p>
