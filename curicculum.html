              <h2>Biography:</h2>
              <p><em>I studied at the <strong><a href="https://www.tum.de/">Technical University of Munich</a></strong> between 2021 and 2024. I learned modern graphic programming techniques, 3D scanning, and deep learning / artificial intelligence development in 2021. I delved into Augmented Reality and game development in 2022. I implemented a serious game for Schön Klinik that helps visually impaired people by teaching them the use of monocular cues with the help of an Augmented Reality application with Hololens 2. I was working on an AR remote collaboration application that would allow experts to investigate machines remotely in 2023.</em></p>
              <p><em>Between my bachelor's and master's studies in 2021, I worked as a front-end developer for <strong><a href="https://urss.hu/de/unsere-firma-3/">Uniqa-Raiffeisen Software Services</a></strong> and I integrated additional features into the website of the Austrian Raiffeisen Bank.</em></p>
              <p><em>I wrote my thesis on object-oriented programming and code quality control with the help of lint applications. I developed an extension for SonarQube that would allow the developers to control the code quality in additional scripting languages. To further understand my thesis topic, I studied design patterns and coding conventions for multiple programming languages such as Java, C++, C#, and Python.</p>
              <p><em>Between 2017 and 2021 I studied at the <strong><a href="https://www.vik.bme.hu/">Budapest University of Technology and Economics</a></strong>. I studied the principles of Assembly and C in 2017 and I learned how to model system architecture and coding in C++ and Java in 2018. I further developed my knowledge of algorithms and encoding techniques in 2019 and I studied cybersecurity and Android development in 2020. In the summer of 2020, I was working for Agrodat to automatize their error detection with an application written in Java.</em></p>
              <p><em>I started programming in C# in 2015 during high school with a private tutor who taught me the basics of an object-oriented programming language. I completed a school leaving exam in informatics where I had to write programs in C# and apply changes to a website with HTML.</em></p>
              <p><em>I got into programming with the Lego Robot and Mindstorm software during my high school years where I assisted in creating a simple robotic hand. I was introduced to Unity 3D Engine by my uncle Peter Vértesi and I became interested in the way games could be developed.</em></p>
              <p>I love tea and Lord of the Rings.</p>
